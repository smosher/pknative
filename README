This is demo code for Korg's excellent padKontrol midi controller, in native mode, demonstrating full control of the device.

Better documentation to come. For now, see the native_demo.c file for documentation.

Requiements:
    make
    gcc
    libportmidi

You can also build it manually with other compilers (clang will work, for example.)
